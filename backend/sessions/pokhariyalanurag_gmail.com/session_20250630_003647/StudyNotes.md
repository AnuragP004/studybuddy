What is Programming?
Computer Programming is a medium for us to communicate
with computers. Just like we use "Hindi" or "English" I
to Communicate with each other, programming is a
way for us to deliver our instructions to the Computer.
What is C
"C is a programming language
C is one of the oldest and finest programming
languages.
C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's
Bell Labs, USA in 1972.
Uses of C
C Language is used to program a wide variety of
Systems. Some of the uses of C are as follows:"
17 Major parts of Windows, Linux and other operating
Systems are written in C.
27 C is used to write driver programs for devices like
Tablets, printers etc.
32 C language is used to program embedded systems where
progrants need to run faster in limited memory (Microware,
Cameras etc.)
42 C is used to develop games, an area where latency is very
important. ie. Computer has to react quickly on user
input.

ðŸ“Œ Summary

Here's a summary of the study notes in bullet points:

**Urban EDG - What is Programming?**

*   **Programming Definition:** A medium for human-computer communication. Like languages (Hindi, English) are used for human communication, programming languages deliver instructions to the computer.

**What is C?**

*   **C Definition:** A programming language (one of the oldest and finest).
*   **C Development:** Developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell Labs, USA in 1972.
*   **Uses of C:**
    *   Core components of operating systems (Windows, Linux).
    *   Device driver programs (tablets, printers, etc.).
    *   Embedded systems programming (micro-waves, cameras, etc.) - fast performance, limited memory.
    *   Game development - low latency is critical.

**Simply Noted Advertisement**

*   Simply Noted offers robotic handwriting services.
*   Uses real pens to create handwriting indistinguishable from a human's.
